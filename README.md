#DESCRIPTION
This is a Unity project of a lateral scroll plataformer game based on the basic movement mechanics of the game VVVVVV this project was made for educational purposes, im glad of how good it came out on the visual aspect but im not so proud of the code wich works but it is not the clean eficient work i like but is good enough for a 16 day project.
